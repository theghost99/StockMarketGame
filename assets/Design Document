2 Choices - Create Game, Join Game (implement Join later)

==FOR BOARD==


Create Game:
  - Allows a game name
  - Allows choice to have you roll manually (click of a button), or automatically after so many seconds (user specifies time)
  - Starts all stocks at 100
  - Displays Roll Button (if manually is selected, start button if not)

Once start button is hit, countdown to next roll is displayed (good countdown GUI object)

When Roll is hit or time to roll happens
  - Rolls dice
    - Rolls # (5, 10, or 20) all 1/3 probability
    - Rolls Action (Div, Up, or Down) all 1/3 probability
    - Rolls Stock (Grain, Industrial, Bonds, Oil, Silver, or Gold) all 1/6 probability
  - Displays Roll
  - If Up or Down is rolled, change value of the stock
  - Keeps track of each roll
  - Sends data to each client
  	- data will be formatted in as int[3]
  		- int[0] = stock number (0-5)
  		- int[1] = action (0 = Div, 1 = Up, 2 = Down)
  		- int[2] = amount (1 = 5, 2 = 10, 3 = 20, 0 = special case:
  			- for div, 0 means no payout, for Up, 0 means SPLIT, for Down, 0 means RESET




==FOR PLAYER==


Join Game:
  - Allows a player to join a game (Roll/Start cannot have been pressed at all)
  - Gives player $5000 to spend on stocks
  - Displays Players stock amounts, cash, and current total value

On Roll
  - If Div - Give cash to player if stock is owned
  - If Up/Down - Adjust total value, if stock is owned, or adjust stock amount if Split/Reset

Buy/Sell Stocks
  - Allows player to buy/sell any stock at current price (if enough cash is on hand)
  - To Buy
    - Has amount of stock, and kind wanted in increments of 500, and displays price (allows to buy if enough cash on hand)
  - To Sell
    - allows person to select kind and amount (up to max they have), and displays amount of money they'd get
    - Allows person to trade straight across to another stock, displays amount of other stocks they'd get for set amount.
    
Buying/Selling process:

1 - Player clicks '+' (for buying) or '-' (for selling) beside the stock they want to select
2.1 - If buying: player can select increments of 500 to purchase.
		- As selection changes, display the amount it will cost
		- Don't allow a user to select more than they can afford
2.2 - If selling: player can select increments of 500 to sell
		- As selection changes, display the amount they will receive
		(Eventually) - Display the other stocks that this could be traded to
3 - Person clicks buy/sell
4.1 - if Buying: money is removed from player, and stocks added
4.2 - if Selling: stock is removed from player, and money added (eventually be able to trade stocks)
5 - Go back to main player display with updated Net Value and stocks

When a roll has occured:

1 - Receive data from board
1.1 - I need to figure out what to do if the player is buying/selling at this time, possibilities:
		- go back to main Player screen with updated values
		- display value of the roll as a short pop-over, and update the values of the sale
2 - Parse data (int[3] as described above)
3.1 - IF ((int[1] == 1 || 2 ) && (int[2] != 0)) THEN: update net value
3.2 - IF ((int[1] == 1 || 2 ) && (int[2] == 0)) THEN: remove/add stock, and reset value of that stock
3.3 - IF ((int[1] == 0) && (int[2] != 0)) THEN: update cash, and net value accordingly
3.4 - IF ((int[1] == 0) && (int[2] == 0)) THEN: DO NOTHING!!
4 - Update main Player screen
